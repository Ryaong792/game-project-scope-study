## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to the following in this file via a pull request:

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
    i added two pictures for the pull request
-   The data structure you plan to use.

    I plan to make sure of arrays and java script.  This area is the hardest
    for me and since i need help structuring what i need to do.

- How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
    I started on this early since CSS and HTML to click better with me.
    I created a game board with Divs with 9 IDs etc.  I will plan to use Jquery
    and JS to add click events and arrays to find the wins.

-   How you plan to approach this project.
    I started with the wireframe then started with a general outline
    of my page with HTML and CSS and tied my JS/Jquery to it.  This way
    i got the general layout on how i wanted my page to look and will add
    login etc after i code each section.

-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
    I want a player to play with AI (might be a reaching here)
    To be able to log in with their own user ID/password
    Signup feature
    to be able to actually play Tic Tac Toe (fear of my jS skill)

-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
    I plan to code my projects in sections may use more then 1 JS script files
-   What creative spin will you add to your project?
    i really enjoy the process of making a site i want my page to look pleasing
    and want a feature to really let you know if you win or lose.

-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
    add/commit and push often with detail discription on what i have done each stage

-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?
    To be honest i want to do them all but i will try first to make sure i get the game
    working to spec before i can proceed to the bonuses.

You may want to submit pictures for your wireframes and/or user stories.
